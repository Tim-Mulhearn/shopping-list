# Shopping List (Vue 3)

Built with vue 3, free to use.

## What I built
- Add items (Enter key or button).
- Remove individual items.
- Clear the current list.
- Save the current list with a custom name (stored in localStorage).
- Load/Edit a saved list.
- Update (overwrite) an existing saved list.
- Delete a saved list (confirmation modal).
- Modal system with backdrop click-to-close.
- Composition API state with Vue 3 (`ref`, `onMounted`).
- Persist saved lists across sessions via `localStorage`.

## Run
Open `index.html` in any browser (or use a simple local server). No build step required.
